    </h1>
    <h2>SECTION 1 — GAME PLAY</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Spoons must only be held with an active muscle, and must be at least 50%
        visible at any one angle.
      </li>
      <li>50% of the whole spoon must be visible AND green.</li>
      <li>
        Only plastic lime green spoons distributed by organizers count as a
        valid "Blammo" spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoons must be whole, but taping fragments together is fine. If
        fragments are not connected via a mechanism (e.g. tape), you are not
        safe.
      </li>
      <li>
        All legal Blammo spoons must be at least 3 inches long. Spoons can be
        acquired by Blammo'ing your target (they must give you their spoon if
        you request it), or by receiving a new spoon from Jackee after
        completing a challenge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every two weeks from the start of Blammo, you need at least one more
        elimination — otherwise you are out. After two weeks: 1 elimination
        required. After four weeks: 2 required. Etc. Rack up eliminations early!
      </li>
      <li>
        Targets rotate once per week. If you are holding your spoon, you are
        safe. You may only hold ONE Blammo spoon at a time. Holding more than
        one = not safe. If multiple people are holding the same spoon, none of
        them are safe.
      </li>
      <li>You cannot tape or attach the spoon to yourself in any way.</li>
      <li>
        To "Blammo" a target: tap them with your valid spoon while they are not
        holding their valid spoon, and say "Blammo!"
      </li>
      <li>
        When you Blammo a target, you inherit their target. Before reporting,
        you must get your target to agree they were Blammo'd, and have them tell
        you your new target. Then report via the official form.
      </li>
      <li>You may not forcibly take or hold someone else's spoon.</li>
      <li>
        You may conceal part of someone's spoon as long as at least 50% remains
        visible.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may take a spoon from someone else with their permission to protect
        yourself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blammos are only valid outside of safe zones (see Section 2) — generally
        during lunch, passing periods, and before/after school.
      </li>

      <li>
        Impersonation of any student or teacher results in immediate
        disqualification.
      </li>
      <li>
        First offense of other rules = warning; second = disqualification
        (case-by-case basis).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>SECTION 2 — BLAMMO-FREE ZONES</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Closed/locked bathroom stalls, locker rooms, and gender-neutral
        bathrooms are safe.
      </li>
      <li>
        ALL scheduled class, club, assembly, affinity group, and advisory times
        are Blammo-free.
      </li>
      <li>
        Classrooms are Blammo-free from scheduled start time until scheduled end
        time OR when all instructional time is over, whichever is later.
      </li>
      <li>Free periods are Blammo-free.</li>
      <li>
        iLab metal shop and woodshop (rooms 114 & 115) are ALWAYS Blammo-free.
      </li>
      <li>
        WoW workshops and trip meetings are Blammo-free (same rules as classes).
        Exception: if off-campus, you may Blammo during the bus/van ride there
        and back only.
      </li>
      <li>
        • Official sports practices, events, and games are Blammo-free. Bus/van
        rides to games are NOT Blammo-free.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may not Blammo a student meeting with teachers/staff (tutorial).
        Informal hallway chats do not count. Official peer-tutor sessions are
        also Blammo-free.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may not Blammo someone if touching them could be dangerous (e.g.
        during a lab).
      </li>
      <li>
        If a Nueva teacher, staff, or faculty declares any activity or location
        Blammo-free, their word is law.
      </li>
      <li>
        "Camping" with the intention of not getting Blammo'd is a rules
        violation.
      </li>
    </ul>
